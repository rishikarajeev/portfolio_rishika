deployments:
  - destination: /public_html
    repo: https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
    branch: main
This example specifies a deployment to the /public_html directory, pulling the code from a GitHub repository.

Customize the configuration:
Customize the configuration based on your needs. You can specify additional settings such as file exclusions, environment variables, or pre/post-deployment commands. Refer to the cPanel documentation for more advanced options: cPanel YAML Guide.

Save the file:
Save the .cpanel.yml file in the root directory of your project.

Test the deployment:
If you're using cPanel's Deployment feature, go to the cPanel interface, find the "Gitâ„¢ Version Control" or a similar section, and trigger the deployment. This will apply the configurations specified in your .cpanel.yml file.

Remember to replace placeholders like yourusername and your-repo with your actual GitHub username and repository.
